# Q&A

## Why?

This topic has been closed. There is not enough information.

## Why can't I pass command line arguments?

(+46 upvotes) Command line arguments use pointers which are BAD.

## Why is there so much copy pasted code

(+13 upvotes) You should avoid pre-processor macros at all costs. They lead to unmanagable code. 

## Why is the sort so slow?

(+54 upvotes) Bubble sort is just fine. Picking a different algorithm would be premature optimization which is the root of all evil.

## Isn't it inefficient to intepret python for everything, even simple commands?

(+242 upvotes) Premature optimization which is the root of all evil

## Why does printing a variable use jQuery? You don't need to include jQuery in everything.

(+16 upvotes) Actually you do. Why use anything else. Even if you're doing an assignment where your instructor explicitly says to not use a 3rd party library, you should do it in jQuery and my anwser will reflect that.

## Why include the entire boost library to use the boost smart pointer when standard library has a perfectly functional one?

(+24 upvotes) You should always use Boost whenever possible. ALWAYS. No exceptions.
